# weather app

A vanilla js app styled with bootstrap. Also used unsplash and openweather api endpoints, and google graphs.


## project goals

* fetching from the weather api
* using data to display nicely in a 5 day forecast (or in a graph as an extra)
* meanwhile also concentrating on the visual of the page


5 day forecast displays the average values of:

- temperature
- wind speed 
- wind directions 
- the weathers state with an index image

 on card templates.

Also added a graph as an extra.
